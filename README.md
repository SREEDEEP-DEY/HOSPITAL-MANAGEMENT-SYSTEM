# 🏥 **Hospital Management System**

---

## 📌 **Problem Statement**

Managing hospital operations manually is **time-consuming**, **inefficient**, and prone to **human error**. From tracking patient records and doctor assignments to managing room availability and staff schedules, hospitals need a reliable system to streamline operations and improve care delivery.

---

## 💡 **Proposed Solution**

This project offers a **console-based Java application** that automates core functionalities of a hospital. It allows for managing patients, doctors, staff, and appointments using an interactive menu-driven interface. The system maintains structured data and ensures quick access to essential information, reducing the need for paper-based processes.

## 🧰 **Tech Stack**

- ☕ **Java** – Core language used for building the application
- 🧠 **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Used to model real-world hospital entities like patients, doctors, staff, etc.
- 🖥️ **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** – For interaction with users
